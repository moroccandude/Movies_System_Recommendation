** Compressed Archive **
ml-data.tar.gz:
A compressed tar file containing the dataset files.
To extract and rebuild the dataset:
gunzip ml-data.tar.gz - Decompresses the .tar.gz file into ml-data.tar.
tar xvf ml-data.tar - Extracts the contents of the .tar file.
mku.sh - Runs a shell script (described later) to generate the specific data files (e.g., training/test splits).
Core Data Files
u.data:
Contains the main ratings data: 100,000 ratings from 943 users on 1,682 items (movies).
Each user has rated at least 20 movies.
Data is randomly ordered and tab-separated with four columns:
user id | item id | rating | timestamp
Details:
user id and item id are numbered consecutively starting from 1.
rating is the user’s rating for the movie (typically on a scale, e.g., 1–5, though not specified here).
timestamp is in Unix seconds since January 1, 1970 (UTC).
u.info:
A summary file providing the total number of users, items (movies), and ratings in u.data.
u.item:
Contains metadata about the movies (items).
Tab-separated list with the following columns:
movie id | movie title | release date | video release date | IMDb URL | unknown | 19 genre fields (e.g., Action, Adventure, etc.).
Genres: The last 19 fields are binary (1 = movie belongs to that genre, 0 = it does not). Movies can belong to multiple genres.
The movie id matches those in u.data.
u.genre:
A simple list of the 19 possible movie genres (e.g., Action, Comedy, Drama).
u.user:
Demographic data about the users.
Tab-separated list with columns:
user id | age | gender | occupation | zip code
The user id matches those in u.data.
u.occupation:
A list of possible occupations for users (e.g., student, engineer, teacher).
Training and Test Splits
The dataset includes pre-split versions of u.data for machine learning experiments, such as cross-validation or train/test evaluation. These are generated using the mku.sh script.

u1.base, u1.test through u5.base, u5.test:
Five pairs of training (base) and test (test) sets.
Each pair represents an 80%/20% split of u.data.
The test sets across u1.test to u5.test are disjoint (non-overlapping).
Purpose: Used for 5-fold cross-validation, where you train and test a model five times (once with each pair) and average the results.
ua.base, ua.test, ub.base, ub.test:
Two additional train/test splits of u.data.
Each test set (ua.test, ub.test) contains exactly 10 ratings per user.
The test sets are disjoint.
Purpose: Useful for evaluating recommendation systems with a fixed number of test ratings per user.

Scripts
allbut.pl:
A Perl script that generates custom training/test splits.
For each user, it places all but n of their ratings in the training set, with the remaining n in the test set.
Allows flexibility in controlling the size of the test set.
mku.sh:
A shell script that automates the creation of all the split datasets (u1.base, u1.test, etc., and ua.base, ua.test, etc.) from u.data.
Running this script after extracting ml-data.tar regenerates these files.
Summary
This dataset is designed for research in recommendation systems or collaborative filtering. Here’s a quick overview:

Core Data: u.data (ratings), u.item (movie info), u.user (user info).
Metadata: u.info, u.genre, u.occupation.
Splits: Predefined train/test sets (u1–u5, ua, ub) for experimentation.
Tools: mku.sh and allbut.pl for generating splits.
